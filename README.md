# TED-dataset
The two sub-datasets, fd-TED and par-TED, will be updated in a regular basis to keep tracks of the new calls for
tender published by the EU states.

- [par-TED](http://share-irisa.univ-ubs.fr/octopusted/pub/par-TED/) is a multilingual aligned corpus in the form of a set of parallel unique sentences translated to at least 23 languages.

- The [fd-TED](http://share-irisa.univ-ubs.fr/octopusted/pub/fd-TED/) corpus is built from the full content of the documents extracted from the  [TED âˆ’ Tenders Electronic Daily platform](https://ted.europa.eu). This dataset can be used as a benchmark for supervised classification or for training machine learning
models applied to business intelligence application.
We also propose a filtered version of fd-ted created by ignoring administrative information.

 ***NB: The currently published dataset, contains only documents released before 2018 in english and french. The rest will be soon available***
